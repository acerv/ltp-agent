# Review Email Template

This file defines the complete format of an LTP patch review reply.
Anything that concerns how the email looks belongs here.

## Output rules

- The entire response MUST start with `Hi `. No preamble, no text before
  or after the email.
- Plain text only. No markdown/HTML.
- Use ASCII characters only.
- Wrap your own text at 78 characters. Long lines in the quoted patch
  may exceed this -- preserve them as-is.
- Quote patch content with `> ` prefix, standard mailing list style.
- Insert your comments directly below the relevant quoted line(s),
  separated by a blank line before and after.
- End every review with a blank line.

## Tone

- Factual. Technical observations, not accusations. Don't over explain.
- Frame issues as **questions about the code**, not statements about the
  author. Avoid "you" / "did you" -- ask about the code.
- NEVER summarize or comment what is correct.
- NEVER use ALL CAPS, except when quoting code that uses it.
- Break up dense paragraphs into multiple small paragraphs.
- Keep enough context that the comment makes sense without the full patch.

## Pre-existing issues

When you notice pre-existing issues in surrounding code not introduced
by the patch, list them after the review. If there are no pre-existing
issues, completely omit this section.

## Structure

This section describes what the review email must look like.

### No issues found

If there are no issues found, use this structure:

```
Hi <firstname>,

On <date>, <author> wrote:

Note:

The agent can sometimes produce false positives although often its
findings are genuine. If you find issues with the review, please
comment this email or ignore the suggestions.

```

### Issues found (single patch)

If there are issues in the patch, use this structure:

```
Hi <firstname>,

On <date>, <author> wrote:
> <patch subject line>

> [relevant diff hunk or code line]

<comment>

> [next relevant hunk]

<comment>

[...]

Verdict - Needs revision

<pre-existing issues, or omit this block entirely if none>

### Issues found (multi-patch series)

If there are issues in one of the patches, reply once, to the first patch.
Use `--- [PATCH N/M] ---` markers between per-patch comments. ONLY include
patches that have findings.
